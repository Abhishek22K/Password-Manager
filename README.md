# Password Manager

## Description
This project is a simple password manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to securely store, display, and manage their passwords for different websites. The passwords are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, and users can view, copy, or delete them.

## Features
- **Store Passwords**: Add website names, usernames, and passwords.
- **Display Passwords**: Display saved passwords in a masked format (e.g., `*********`).
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy website names, usernames, or passwords to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Delete Passwords**: Remove stored passwords from the list.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
  
## Files
